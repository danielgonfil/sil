Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net eth_tx_clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): eth_tx_clk_IBUF_inst/O, i_FC_1002_MII/MII_TX_CLK
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) qspi_dq[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (qspi_dq[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
